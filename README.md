# Typescript Degree
Personal studies on not so basic typescript topics.

My own degree on Typescript:

* Generics   
* Types vs Interfaces
* Iterators and Generators
* Decorators
* Mixins
... (much more later)

## Why?

Because I don't these topics yet, and I am learning the fundamentals, practicing, and mastering on them. 

## Food for thought

 “Motivation alone is not enough. If you have an idiot and you motivate him, now you have a motivated idiot.” – Jim Rohn
